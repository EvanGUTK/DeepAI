NVIDIA PeopleNet is a pre-trained AI model for detecting and tracking people in video streams. It is part of NVIDIA's TAO Toolkit models and works best with DeepStream SDK. PeopleNet can be deployed on systems with NVIDIA GPUs for real-time analytics.

Prerequisites
Hardware: An NVIDIA GPU (e.g., RTX 20/30/40 series).
Software:
CUDA Toolkit (required for GPU acceleration).
NVIDIA Drivers (latest version).
DeepStream SDK (or an equivalent framework).
Docker (for portability on Linux/macOS).


Setup for Each Platform
Windows
Step 1: Install CUDA and NVIDIA Drivers
Download and install the latest NVIDIA GPU Driver from here.
Install the CUDA Toolkit:
Download CUDA from NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.
Follow the installation guide to integrate with Visual Studio.
Step 2: Install DeepStream SDK
DeepStream SDK is not natively available for Windows. Instead, you need a Linux environment using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
Follow the Linux Setup to install DeepStream via Docker in WSL2.
Step 3: Download and Test PeopleNet
After setting up WSL2 and DeepStream, follow the Linux instructions to run PeopleNet.
Step 4: Visualize Results
Save detection results as videos or images in WSL2.
Access the results from the shared directory in Windows.

Linux
Step 1: Install NVIDIA Drivers and CUDA
Install the latest NVIDIA driver:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-525
Install CUDA Toolkit:
bash
Copy code
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2004.pin
sudo mv cuda-ubuntu2004.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/ /"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cuda
Step 2: Install NVIDIA DeepStream SDK
Add the DeepStream repository:
bash
Copy code
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/deepstream-6.3_6.3.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i deepstream-6.3_6.3.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update
Install DeepStream:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install deepstream-6.3
Step 3: Download PeopleNet Model
Visit NVIDIA NGC and download PeopleNet (.etlt or .trt format).
Place the model in /models/peoplenet/.
Step 4: Configure DeepStream
Edit the DeepStream config file to use PeopleNet:
Open /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/configs/deepstream-app/source1_primary.txt.
Update the model-engine-file path to point to your PeopleNet model:
ini
Copy code
model-engine-file=/models/peoplenet/peoplenet_model.trt
Step 5: Run PeopleNet
Test PeopleNet with DeepStream:
bash
Copy code
deepstream-app -c /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/configs/deepstream-app/source1_primary.txt
Save outputs (e.g., videos) by configuring the sink section of the file.
macOS
Since CUDA and DeepStream are not natively supported on macOS, alternatives include:

Option 1: Use Docker with DeepStream
Install Docker Desktop for macOS.
Run a Linux-based DeepStream container with GPU passthrough (only on Intel Macs with an NVIDIA eGPU):
bash
Copy code
docker run --gpus all -it --rm nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:6.3-triton
Follow the Linux instructions to configure and run PeopleNet.
Option 2: Use Cloud Platforms
Use a cloud-based GPU solution like AWS, Google Colab, or Paperspace.
Deploy PeopleNet using DeepStream in the cloud.
Download and visualize the results on macOS.
4. Universal Demo Hosting on GitHub
To create a demo for GitHub Pages:

Save PeopleNet outputs (videos/images) from any platform.
Create a simple HTML webpage to display the results.
Host the webpage using GitHub Pages:
Push your files (HTML, CSS, media) to the docs/ folder in your GitHub repository.
Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
