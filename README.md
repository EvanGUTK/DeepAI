# DeepAI
While in University, I want to research AI, this may be code, demonstrations, how-to, or discussion. My main focus is AI in manufacturing use, medical advancements, and deep learning.

#About
- Deep AI is a storthand folling deep learning. Deep learing is used mainly in my Forklift AI project training the program to identify objects based on mass collection of data, specifically images. There are web based sites where you can pratice deep learing. Such, Kaggle. You can learn the fundamentals of deep learning using your own photos to label objects based on the images. After, you can use your webcam to place that said item infront of the camera and it will draw a bounding box labeling that said item correctly.If said item does not have qualitative images then the error rate could be higher than quantitative images.
